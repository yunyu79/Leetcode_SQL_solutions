# Q: A single number is a number that appeared only once in the MyNumbers table.
# Find the largest single number. If there is no single number, report null.

# S:                            -------------------------> The syntax of ISNULL and IFNULL are the same. IFNULL(expression, alternative value if expression is NULL)
SELECT IFNULL(MAX(num), NULL) AS num
FROM MyNumbers 
WHERE num IN (
    SELECT num
    FROM MyNumbers
    GROUP BY num
    HAVING COUNT(num) = 1
);

# S2: Another method is to create new table to SELECT MAX value, instead of adding conditions in WHERE clause. 
SELECT MAX(num) AS num 
FROM (
    SELECT num 
    FROM MyNumbers 
    GROUP BY num 
    HAVING COUNT(num) = 1
