# We define query quality as: The average of the ratio between query rating and its position.
# We also define poor query percentage as: The percentage of all queries with rating less than 3.

# Q: Write a solution to find each query_name, the quality and poor_query_percentage.
# Both quality and poor_query_percentage should be rounded to 2 decimal places.

# S:                                                                        ------------------>  CASE WHEN expression is used with SELECT clause. This method can make SUM() 
to return the number of rows about rating < 3 just like COUNT().

    CASE
    WHEN rating < 3 THEN 1
