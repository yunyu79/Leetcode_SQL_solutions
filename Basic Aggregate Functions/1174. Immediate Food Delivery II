# If the customer's preferred delivery date is the same as the order date, then the order is called immediate; otherwise, it is called scheduled.
# The first order of a customer is the order with the earliest order date that the customer made. It is guaranteed that a customer has precisely one first order.

# Q: Write a solution to find the percentage of immediate orders in the first orders of all customers, rounded to 2 decimal places.

# S:              ----------------------> According to the requirement of question, we need to 
#                                         find the smallest order_date in each group. ------> GROUP BY + MIN in SELECT clause.
