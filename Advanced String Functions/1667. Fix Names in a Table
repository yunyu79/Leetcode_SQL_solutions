# Q: Write a solution to fix the names so that only the first character is uppercase and the rest are lowercase.
# Return the result table ordered by user_id.

# S:              ---------------> UPPER(): make all characters in a string to be uppercase, so we need to speicify the first char to be uppercase by LEFT(string, length). 
                  ---------------> LOWER(): Same, but we need to change all characters into lowercase, except the first one, by using RIGHT(). This function starts from right.

SELECT user_id, CONCAT(UPPER(LEFT(name,1)), LOWER(RIGHT(name, LENGTH(name)-1))) AS name 
FROM Users
ORDER BY user_id;
