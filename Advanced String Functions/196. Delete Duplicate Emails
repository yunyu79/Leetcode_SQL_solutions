# Q: Write a solution to delete all duplicate emails, keeping only one unique email with the smallest id.
# For SQL users, please note that you are supposed to write a DELETE statement and not a SELECT one.
# After running your script, the answer shown is the Person table. The driver will first compile and run your piece of code and then show the Person table. 
# The final order of the Person table does not matter.

# S1: 
DELETE p1
FROM Person p1 JOIN Person p2
ON p1.email = p2.email AND p1.id > p2.id;

# S2: The first thing is to find out MIN(id) by groupping email. Then, we filter the ids which are NOT IN the result of subquery.
