# Q: Write a solution to find the second highest salary from the Employee table. If there is no second highest salary, return null (return None in Pandas).

# S:               -----------------> We can just only use SELECT without any other clause, if there is no need to get data from a table or we just output some calculations. 
SELECT IFNULL((
    SELECT DISTINCT salary
    FROM Employee
    ORDER BY salary DESC
    Limit 1 OFFSET 1
), NULL) AS SecondHighestSalary;
