Table: Queue

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| person_id   | int     |
| person_name | varchar |
| weight      | int     |
| turn        | int     |
+-------------+---------+

# This table has the information about all people waiting for a bus.
# The person_id and turn columns will contain all numbers from 1 to n, where n is the number of rows in the table.
# turn determines the order of which the people will board the bus, where turn=1 denotes the first person to board and turn=n denotes the last person to board.

# There is a queue of people waiting to board a bus. However, the bus has a weight limit of 1000 kilograms, so there may be some people who cannot board.

# Q: Write a solution to find the person_name of the last person that can fit on the bus without exceeding the weight limit. 
# The test cases are generated such that the first person does not exceed the weight limit.

# S:                            ------------> JOIN tables: We can JOIN tables using unequal expression. After JOINing, there may be one to many, and it's OKAY and works!
