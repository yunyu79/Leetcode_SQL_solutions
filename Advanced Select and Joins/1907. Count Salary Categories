# Q: Write a solution to calculate the number of bank accounts for each salary category. The salary categories are:
# "Low Salary": All the salaries strictly less than $20000.
# "Average Salary": All the salaries in the inclusive range [$20000, $50000].
# "High Salary": All the salaries strictly greater than $50000.
# The result table must contain all three categories. If there are no accounts in a category, return 0.    ---------> If we don't need to return 0 if there are no accounts 
                                                                                                                      in a category, we can use S2. However, S1 is simpler. 

# S1: 
SELECT 'High Salary' AS category, SUM(IF(income>50000, 1, 0)) AS accounts_count
FROM Accounts
UNION
SELECT 'Average Salary' AS category, SUM(IF(income<=50000 AND income >= 20000, 1, 0)) AS accounts_count
FROM Accounts
UNION
SELECT 'Low Salary' AS category, SUM(IF(income<20000, 1, 0)) AS accounts_count
FROM Accounts;

# S2: 
SELECT category2 AS category, IFNULL(COUNT(category2), 0) AS accounts_count 
FROM Accounts a1 JOIN (
    SELECT account_id, (
    CASE
        WHEN income > 50000 THEN 'High Salary'
        WHEN income < 20000 THEN 'Low Salary'
        ELSE 'Average Salary'
    END
    ) AS category2
    FROM Accounts
) AS a2
ON a1.account_id = a2.account_id
GROUP BY category2;
