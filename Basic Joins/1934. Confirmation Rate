# The confirmation rate of a user is the number of 'confirmed' messages divided by the total number of requested   --> seems like to use division, but in this case, division is hard, becuase we need to know two COUNT() based on different filter conditions in a block.
# confirmation messages. The confirmation rate of a user that did not request any confirmation messages is 0.      --> We are given a hint. Since no confirmation can be treat as 0, we can use AVG to calculate replacing division. 
# Round the confirmation rate to two decimal places.

# Q: Write a solution to find the confirmation rate of each user.

# S: 
SELECT s.user_id, ROUND(AVG(if(c.action='confirmed',1,0)),2) AS confirmation_rate 
FROM Signups s LEFT JOIN Confirmations c
ON s.user_id = c.user_id
GROUP BY user_id;
