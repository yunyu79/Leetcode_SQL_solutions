Output: 1. All students and subjects are required, even though they didn't attend exams about it. --> CROSS JOIN + LEFT JOIN;
2. Zeros are shown for some students who didn't attend. --> Need to count the column including NULL. 
--> SELECT...COUNT(Examinations.subject_name)

# Q: Write a solution to find the number of times each student attended each exam. 

# S: See Output session. It is important to select columns from which table needed to SELECT, WHERE, GROUP, HAVING, ORDER 
# when using LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and CROSS JOIN, because different values could be shown in different original tables 
# after joining, even though they have the same column names.
