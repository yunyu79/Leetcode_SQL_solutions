# Q: Write a solution to report the name and bonus amount of each employee with a bonus less than 1000.

# S: The key to solve this problem is using LEFT JOIN, because all employees' bonus, less than 1000, are needed to output. 
# Also, if someone's bonus is null, the info is needed to output. --> WHERE clause adds a condition of bonus IS NULL. 

SELECT name, bonus 
FROM Employee e LEFT JOIN Bonus b
ON e.empId = b.empId 
WHERE bonus < 1000 OR bonus IS NULL;
