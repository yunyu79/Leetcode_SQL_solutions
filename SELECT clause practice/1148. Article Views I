# Each row of this table indicates that some viewer viewed an article (written by some author) on some date. 
# Note that equal author_id and viewer_id indicate the same person --> HAVING author_id = viewer_id

# Q: Write a solution to find all the authors that viewed at least one of their own articles.  --> GROUP BY + HAVING 
# Q: Return the result table sorted by id in ascending order. --> ORDER BY 

# Solution: Q needs us to return which articles are viewed by their authors. 
# So we need to write GROUP BY to know which articles and authors
