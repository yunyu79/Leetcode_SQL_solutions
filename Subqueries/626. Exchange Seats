# Q: Write a solution to swap the seat id of every two consecutive students. If the number of students is odd, the id of the last student is not swapped.
# Return the result table ordered by id in ascending order.

# S:
SELECT (
    CASE 
    WHEN id % 2 = 1 AND id < (
        SELECT COUNT(*)
        FROM Seat
    ) THEN id + 1
    WHEN id % 2 = 0 THEN id - 1
    ELSE id
    END
) AS id, student 
FROM Seat 
ORDER BY id;
