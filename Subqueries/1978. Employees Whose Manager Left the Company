Table: Employees

| Column Name | Type     |

| employee_id | int      |
| name        | varchar  |
| manager_id  | int      |
| salary      | int      |

# Q: Find the IDs of the employees whose salary is strictly less than $30000 and whose manager left the company. When a manager leaves the company, 
# their information is deleted from the Employees table, but the reports still have their manager_id set to the manager that left.
# Return the result table ordered by employee_id.

# S1: 
SELECT e1.employee_id
FROM Employees e1 LEFT JOIN Employees e2
ON e1.manager_id = e2.employee_id 
WHERE (e1.manager_id IS NOT NULL) AND (e2.employee_id IS NULL) AND e1.salary < 30000
ORDER BY e1.employee_id;

# S2: Using subquery. I think this method is better. 
SELECT employee_id 
FROM Employees 
WHERE manager_id NOT IN (
    SELECT employee_id 
    FROM Employees 
) AND salary < 30000 
ORDER BY employee_id;
